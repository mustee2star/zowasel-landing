                        <br>
                        <br>
    
                        
                       4. Terms Applicable to Sellers; The following provisions contained in this Section 5 apply to the extent You participate in
                        the Zowasel Marketplace as a seller or a potential seller of crops. From time to time, Zowasel may present a bid to
                        purchase from You (a "Grower Bid"), or You may submit an offer to sell to Zowasel (a "Grower Offer"), a certain quantity
                        of a crop of a certain quality. Any additional terms or conditions, including without limitation price, quality
                        specifications, and additional services, will be included In the Grower Bid or Grower Offer, which shall be on the
                        applicable Zowasel Marketplace form provided by Zowasel. Each Grower Bid will remain open until the time at which
                        Zowasel issues a cancellation of the Grower Bid, and each Grower Offer will remain open until the time at which You
                        revoke the Grower Offer or the Grower Offer expires in accordance with its terms. For clarification, any Grower Bid can
                        be canceled by Zowasel at any time prior to Zowasel's receipt of Your formal acceptance of a Grower Bid. A Grower Offer
                        submitted by You will become irrevocable upon Zowasel's acceptance of such Grower Offer. If You successfully accept a
                        Grower Bid or Zowasel accepts a Grower Offer, such acceptance will be reflected in a binding written confirmation issued
                        by Zowasel. No Zowasel Marketplace transaction is binding on Zowasel until such written confirmation is issued by
                        Zowasel, which may be issued or not issued in Zowasel's sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, on the Marketplace
                        Platform, a Grower Bid may be referenced to as a "Bid" and a Grower Offer may be referenced to as an "Offer" or any
                        other terms as may be adopted by Zowasel, and the use of such alternative terms will not relieve You of the terms,
                        conditions or obligations relating to such Grower Bid or Grower Offer set forth in these Terms and Conditions or any
                        other agreement between You and Zowasel.
    
                        <br>
                        <br>
    
                        
                       5. Terms Applicable to Buyers; The following provisions contained in this Section 6 apply to the extent You participate in
                        the Zowasel Marketplace as a buyer or a potential buyer of crops. From time to time, You may submit a bid to purchase
                        from Zowasel (a "Buyer Bid"), or Zowasel may present an offer to sell to You (a "Buyer Offer"), a certain quantity of a
                        crop of a certain quality. Any additional terms or conditions, including without limitation price, quality
                        specifications, and additional services, will be included In the Buyer Bid or Buyer Offer, which shall be on the
                        applicable Zowasel Marketplace form provided by Zowasel. Each Buyer Bid will remain open for the earlier of (i)
                        twenty-four (24) hours from submission or (ii) thirty (30) minutes following Zowasel's receipt of Your cancellation (the
                        "Bid Period"). Once a Buyer Bid is placed with Zowasel, You irrevocably commit to purchase any quantity of the crop
                        meets the terms of Your Buyer Bid that Zowasel Is able to commit to filling during the Bid Period. For the avoidance of
                        doubt, Zowasel has full and sole discretion to either accept or reject a Buyer Bid, or any portion thereof. Each Buyer
                        Offer will remain open until the time at which Zowasel issues a cancellation of the Buyer Offer. For clarification, any
                        Buyer Offer can be canceled by Zowasel at any time prior to Zowasel's receipt of Your formal acceptance of a Buyer
                        Offer. If You successfully accept a Buyer Offer or Zowasel accepts a Buyer Bid, such acceptance will be reflected in a
                        binding written confirmation issued by Zowasel. No Zowasel Marketplace transaction is binding on Zowasel until such
                        written confirmation is issued by Zowasel, which may be issued or not issued in Zowasel's sole discretion. For the
                        avoidance of doubt, on the Marketplace Platform, a Buyer Bid may be referenced to as a "Bid" and a Buyer Offer may be
                        referenced to as an "Offer" or any other terms as may be adopted by Zowasel, and the use of such alternative terms will
                        not relieve You of the terms, conditions or obligations relating to such Buyer Bid or Buyer Offer set forth in these
                        Terms and Conditions or any other agreement between You and Zowasel.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        6. Cancellations; Suspensions. To ensure the integrity of the Zowasel Marketplace and the Marketplace Platform, Zowasel
                        may, in its sole and absolute discretion, based on numerous factors, including, without limitation, logistics, past
                        experience and performance, creditworthiness, qualifications, or any other relevant consideration, cancel or terminate
                        any Grower Offer, Grower Bid, Buyer Offer or Buyer Bid, or suspend or terminate the participation of any user of the
                        Marketplace Platform or participant in the Zowasel Marketplace.

                        <br>
                        
                       7. Crop Sampling; To the extent You are a seller of crops on the Zowasel Marketplace, to ensure the proper functioning of
                        the Zowasel Marketplace, You agree to (i) provide, upon Zowasel’s request, a crop sample indicative of the crop enrolled
                        in the Zowasel Marketplace for quality testing; and (ii) following quality testing, use best efforts to keep the portion
                        of Your crop that was tested segregated from non-test crops, and notify Zowasel if part, or all, of such crop, is

                        subject matter of this Terms of Use. The failure of either party to exercise any right or remedy under this Terms of Use
                        or at law shall not prevent any further exercise of that right or remedy. You may not assign this Terms of Use without
                        the prior written consent of Zowasel. If any part, term or provision of this Agreement is held illegal, invalid or
                        unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the Agreement shall not be affected. These Terms of
                        Use and your use of the Marketplace Platform and Website shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of
                        Delaware, and the federal laws of the United States, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. Any disputes
                        related to specific transactions on the Zowasel Marketplace will be governed by National Grain &amp; Feed Association
                        (“NGFA”) trade rules (the “Rules”) in effect on the date the dispute arises, and any dispute will be referred to NGFA
                        arbitration in accordance with the Rules. The parties agree that the sole forum for the resolution of all disagreements
                        or disputes relating to crop transactions arising under the Zowasel Marketplace between You and Zowasel shall be
                        arbitration proceedings before the NGFA pursuant to the Rules. The decision and award determined by such arbitration
                        shall be final and binding upon the parties and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                        thereof. The language of the Agreement is English and all obligations under and communications relating to the Agreement
                        shall be conducted in English. The Parties acknowledge that a material breach relating to certain provisions of this
                        Terms of use may, by its gravity or nature, cause immediate or irreparable injury to the other Party that cannot be
                        adequately compensated for in damages. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
                        event of any such material breach and in addition to all other remedies available herein, the non-breaching Party may
                        seek solely injunctive relief (including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or permanent injunction)
                        from any court of competent jurisdiction, without posting a bond or other security. You agree that regardless of any
                        statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Marketplace
                        Platform, Website or these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or
                        be forever barred. With respect to an unauthorized user there are no time limitations with respect to any action brought
                        by Zowasel other than the applicable statute of limitations.
